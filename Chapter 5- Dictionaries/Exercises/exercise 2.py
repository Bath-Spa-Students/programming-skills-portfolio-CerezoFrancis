#Exercise 2: Glossary
#Creating a glossary with words that I have learned from previous chapters 
glossary =  {
    'variable': 'A named reference to a value that can be changed.',
    'string': 'A collection of alphabets, words orother characters.',
    'function': 'A block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action.',
    'import': 'To make a code in one module available in another.',
    'concatenation': 'Joining two or more strings to create a single new string.'
}

#Printing each word and its meaning
print(f"Variable: \t{glossary['variable']}\n")
print(f"String: \t{glossary['string']}\n")
print(f"Function: \t{glossary['function']}\n")
print(f"Import: \t{glossary['import']}\n")
print(f"Concatenation: \t{glossary['concatenation']}\n")
